React Redux
Redux is a predictable state management tool often used with React applications. 

State: The single source of truth for the application's data.

Store: Central repository holding the state of the application.

Reducer: Pure function that specifies how the state changes in response to actions.

Action: Plain JavaScript objects that describe what happened (e.g., {type: 'INCREMENT'}).

Dispatch: Function to send an action to the reducer to update the state.

Subscribe: A listener function that triggers whenever the state changes.
